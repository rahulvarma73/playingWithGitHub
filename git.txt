git clone <-some link->

git status


When we use git status there are four status codes

untracked - newfiles that git doesn't track
modified - files that are modified
staged - file is ready to be commited
unmodified - unchanged

Add & Commit

add - adds new or modified files in your working directory to the git staging area
git add <-file name-> // adds single file.
git add .             // adds all the files that are new or modified.


commit - it is the record of the change
git commit -m "some message"


push - upload from local repo to remote repo

git push origin <-branch name->     
// origin: the name of git repo by defualt 

Branch Commands

git branch - to check branch

git branch -M <-new branchname-> (rename branch)

git checkout <-branchname->  (navigate)

git checkout -b <-branchname-> (create branch)

git branch -d <-branchname-> (delete branch)


Merging Code

way 1
// you are in a particular branch and you want compare your code with other branch
git diff <-branchname->   (to compare commits,branches,files&more)

way 2
